# Detection-de-fraude-des-transactions-en-ETC

The Ethereum network, is subject to a number of assaults. The most famous attack, that we already mentioned, is known as a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack, and it happened in 2016. The DAO is a contract code that has a flaw that has resulted in the theft of more than USD 50 million [1]. The phishing scam is another sort of fraud that has emerged on the Ethereum network since its inception. It is a type of fraud that obtains personal information and disseminates fraudulent account addresses. Phishing websites try to steal Ethereum wallet keys, or online to acquire money directly. There are lots of other kinds of fraud: Ponzi schemes, Hake, Scamming, â€¦ According to cnbc.com, over 10$ billion were lost to decentralized finance scams in 2021.
All of these frauds make it mandatory to have intrusion detection system (IDS) on blockchain networks. However, such a system mining a (big enough) dataset, labeling it, and making a good classifier. We will try in the following project to cover all these steps.
We will try to answer the following questions:
1. Are scammers databases enough to create anomaly detection models ?
2. Which classifier works the best for this task?
3. Which features are best determining the fraudulent nature of a transaction, in this context?
